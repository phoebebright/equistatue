# Privacy
- we ask you to login to avoid haivng bots make a mess of our data and so we don't ask you to score the same statues more than once.
- we are using the same login system as we use for Skor.ie and Whinn.ie to save time, so you may already have a login.
- once we are done we will remove the link between scores and who did them
- we can delete your account at any time.
- we don't do any mailings on this project, so any emails, other than login/registration/forgot password emails will come from me personally
